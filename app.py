Anthracnose in pomegranates, caused by the fungus Glomerella cingulata, shows up as black spots with a yellow halo on leaves, premature leaf dropping, and dark discoloration on fruits. This fungus sticks around in infected plant leftovers and spreads when it rains or the wind blows in spring. To stop it, use healthy plants, ones that can handle the fungus, and keep the area well-ventilated and clean by getting rid of fallen leaves and sick branches. It is also good to spray stuff that kills the fungus early on and to keep your tools clean. Just keep an eye out for any signs of trouble, and if you see any, take action to stop itÂ fromÂ spreading.',

Bacterial blight in pomegranates, caused by Bacterium Xanthomonas, leads to visible symptoms like yellowish water-soaked circular spots on the plants within 2-3 days of infection, often resulting in leaves falling prematurely. As the disease worsens, these spots become irregular and turn dark brown at their centers, affecting the stems and branches by causing cracking and girdling. This bacterial infection can also lead to tissue death on leaves and twigs and may cause fruits to crack open, dry out, and darken. Anyone can recognize the signs, and preventive steps include using natural remedies like neem leaves and garlic extract, along with proper sanitation and planting practices. It is crucial to remove infected plant parts regularly and avoid waterlogging to protectÂ theÂ crop.',

This can be prevented by spraying at 15days interval of a fungicide. This disease occurs due different soil concentration and rainfall. Infection spreads fast due to humidity and rainfall.
